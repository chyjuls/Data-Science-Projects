# Data Science and Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of data science and machine learning projects that I've worked on.

## About
In this repository, I've attempted to solve a variety of real-world problems using data science and machine learning methodologies. You'll find a diverse set of projects ranging from exploratory data analysis, predictive modelling, natural language processing, to deep learning and reinforcement learning.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects you'll find in this repository:

1. **Predictive Modelling**: Used machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes based on data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Investigated datasets to discover patterns and relationships between variables.
3. **Unsupervised Learning**: 

## Technologies Used

The projects in this repository have been implemented using a variety of data science tools and technologies, including:

- Python
- R
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- PyTorch

## How to Use

Each project in this repository is contained within its own directory, complete with the dataset used (if permissible) and a Jupyter notebook that walks through the problem, the solution, and any interesting insights found along the way. To run the notebooks, you'll need to have Jupyter installed, along with the necessary libraries. See the individual project README files for more specific instructions.
